 DROP ->

DROP queries are used to delete a database or table.
You should also be careful when using this type of query because
it will remove everything, including table definition along with all the data, 
indexes, triggers, constraints and permission specifications for that table.


//EXAMPLE  //

DROP TABLE table_name;
